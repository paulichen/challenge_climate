Intern program challenge answers:

Q: What is the O() complexity of your solution?

A: O(n)


Q: What is the complexity class  (P, NP, NP-complete, etc) of this problem?

A: P - because the problem can e solved deterministically in a polynomial time and has a deterministic automata for its solution.
